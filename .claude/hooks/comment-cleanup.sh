# Delete-only comment hygiene pass. Spawns a Sonnet subagent that may only remove

#
# Two entry points, one rule set:
#
#   1. Explicit file list (what the `refactor` skill calls):
#        .claude/hooks/comment-cleanup.sh src/db/repo.ts etl/glaze_etl/core/loader.py
#      Files are edited in place and left unstaged, so the caller can review the diff.
#
#   2. PreToolUse hook on `git commit`: reads the hook payload on stdin, cleans the
#      staged files and re-stages them so the commit picks the cleanup up. Note that
#      re-staging adds each file whole, so a partially staged file (`git add -p`) has
#      its remaining hunks swept into the commit as well.
#
# Always exits 0 — a missing `claude`, missing `jq` or a subagent failure must never
# block a real commit.

Clean up comments in the listed files. This codebase documents intent deliberately —
most of its comments explain WHY a non-obvious choice was made, and those are the most
valuable prose in the repo. Your job is to remove the noise around them, not to thin
them out. When a comment is even arguably load-bearing, leave it.

Delete:
- Step-banner narration ("# Step 1: ...", "// ===== SECTION =====" dividers).
- Changelog and reviewer-addressed comments: "Previously...", "Updated to...",
  "This fixes...", "Per the plan...", "As requested...", "Renamed from...".
- Commented-out code (any commented line that would parse as code).
- Comments that contradict the code they sit next to — they went stale in a refactor.
- Comments that only restate WHAT the next line does when the line already says it
  ("// increment the counter" above `count += 1`).
- Docstring Args:/Returns: sections that only repeat the type hints. Leave the prose
  part of the docstring alone.

Keep:
- Anything explaining WHY: constraints, workarounds, third-party quirks, ordering
  assumptions, "this is a seam" notes, rationale for a surprising default.
- Module and class docstrings.
- TODO/FIXME comments, shebangs, coding declarations, license headers, type-checker
  and linter directives (`# type: ignore`, `# noqa`, `// @ts-expect-error`,
  `// eslint-disable-*`).

Hard constraints:
- Only DELETE comment lines or trim comment text. Never add a comment, never reword
  one, never change code, strings, imports, or whitespace on code lines.
- If unsure, leave it. A kept mediocre comment costs nothing; a deleted good one is
  lost work.
- Do not narrate. Do not summarize. Edit the files and finish.
